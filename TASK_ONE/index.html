        The concept of zodiac encompasses a system of astrological beliefs based
        on the division of the ecliptic into twelve equal segments, each
        associated with a specific constellation. These segments, known as
        zodiac signs, are believed to influence individual personalities,
        behaviors, and destinies based on the time of a person's birth. The
        twelve signs, such as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and so forth, are often
        used in horoscopes and astrological readings to provide insights into
        various aspects of life, including love, career, and health. While some
        view zodiac signs as a form of entertainment or self-reflection, others
        adhere to them as guiding principles in decision-making and life
        planning.
